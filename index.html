    <h1>Outside Art Event</h1>
    <h2>Introduction: I attended Kristin Nowlin's art exhibition.</h2>
        <p>Description and dates of event: The exhibit was held on August 24th at the Manhattan Arts Center. Nowlin's exhibit was the first time I had attended a professional art gallery, and it was great to experience opening night.</p>
    <h3>Topic Sentence: The art exhibit was filled with prints created by woodblock carvings.</h3>
        <p>paragraph 1: Colonial styles images are all depicted in the show. The stories involved contain different racial and socioeconomic statuses in historical time periods. The use of just black and white added heavy contrast and played into the meaning behind the artwork, as many pieces were commentary on race and segregation. Every artwork piece contains dynamic figures and movement that add to the story and meaning. Unique textures and detail draw the eyes in and form unity. One of my favorite pieces is a print of two white women in a bedroom with two of their slaves. The slaves are folding clothes while one of the white women shows off a dress that she is currently trying on. My favorite parts about this artwork are the details and the symbolism. The wallpaper in the background creates rhythm and keeps the eye moving to each person in the scene. Family is greatly depicted in this piece, and it clearly brings up the struggle between race and the idea of ancestors.</p>
    <h4>Topic Sentence: Each piece reveals stories of the past and challenges history by examining the relationships and culture of that specific time period.</h4>
        <p>paragraph 2: This artwork criticizes the faults of the time period by bringing a narrative to the surface that is different from the narrative the history books give. Another art piece I enjoy is one depicting slave owners and their slaves. America tends to reflect on the past and think only of the good aspects, such as the wealthc, the beautiful houses, and the fancy clothing. This piece challenges that view by describing a different historical narrative. In this artwork, the house is behind a white picket fence. Normally, a white picket fence would symbolize a wealthy and happy family, usually depicted as white. The artwork changes that idea by showing the slave point of view instead, which is still the reality of history. The slaves are distraught and nervous, and it seems that they are worried about what the couple are discussing. Whether they are talking about some sort of punishment for the slaves, the work they must do next, or a negotiation to purchase them, it is clear that the outcome of this private conversation will not end well for the slaves.</p>
    <h5>Conclusion: Nowlin's artwork is appealing to look and, and it contains deeper meaning that forces the viewer to reflect on history.</h5>
        <p>concluding paragraph: Each artwork makes the viewer contemplate history and what they have been told in the history books. Nowlin's exhibit reveals the truth about history that can be tucked away and hidden. I appreciate the attention to detail and the dynamic feel that still brings unity to every piece. Getting to see art work in a professional studio was a great experience, and I enjoyed getting to interact in person with the artist and the artwork.</p>
